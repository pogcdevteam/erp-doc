Datatable component has been used in the project in multiple places where we need to render a nice and responsive table for users with search and export options.

You can visit website for more information about use cases: [**Datatable**](https://datatables.net/)

###### Implementation

In order to render datatable for html tables you need to set id attribute of that table tag to "dataTable".

    <table id="dataTable">
    </table>

###### Export Buttons

Export and print options enabled for end user. User can export data to excel and csv files and also is able to print the whole table at once.

###### Static Files

Databale static files are stored in datatable directory.
